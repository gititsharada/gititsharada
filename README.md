## About me
Hi, I'm Sharada — originally from the Himalayan country of Nepal 🇳🇵, now pursuing my Master's in Smart Energy Systems at Hochschule Ansbach, Germany 🇩🇪.

My passion lies at the intersection of mathematics and sustainability. I specialize in the **optimization of multi-vector energy systems**, and I’m particularly interested in developing mathematical models to support net-zero transitions. I currently use tools like **Python, Excel, and Octave** for simulation and optimization projects.

Beyond studies, I love peaceful early mornings with coffee and birdsong, strumming my guitar on sunny days, and exchanging ideas with passionate individuals in the field of sustainability.
  
## Learning Journey
I'm currently working on **performance analysis of smart grids** and building my fluency in **German (aiming for B1)**. 

My entrepreneurial curiosity led me to explore a concept for a **Smart Battery System for apartment homes** - It is in early research phase.

You’ll find my study notes and coursework in **individual subject repositories** on this GitHub — it's a growing collection and a work in progress.


## Personal Side & Personality
I love visiting places I’ve read about in books or seen in films. I also go on what I call *Destiny Weekends* — spontaneous train journeys to random villages or cities across Germany. These adventures keep me inspired.

My dream milestone is to witness a net-zero planet — and contribute directly to making that happen through the work I do.

## Community, Collaboration & Goals
I'm open to collaboration on **scientific writing**, student projects, and energy simulations. I love working with people from different disciplines and backgrounds — it sparks the best ideas.

I'm especially looking to connect with others who are passionate about **sustainability, optimization, and energy system innovation**.

## 🎯 2025 Goals
- ✅ Write and publish 2 articles on Medium about my energy journey
- 🛠️ Complete and publish a Smart Grid Simulation project on GitHub
- 🔗 Connect with 20+ energy professionals on LinkedIn
- 🇩🇪 Reach B1 level in German for professional communication
- ✨ Launch my Smart Battery System concept as an early-stage idea
- 🎒 Backpacking through Germany
