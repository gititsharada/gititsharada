## üîß About me
Hi, I am Sharada. I am from the land of Himalayas, Nepal. A beautiful country in South Asia. My aim has always been to work in the field of sustainability through energy systems. Germany being the leading nation in the net-zero energy usage, it was the easy choice for my masters. The journey has been beautiful so far. I am enjoying having coffee early morning with the sound of birds, playing guitar on a sunny day, and listening to amazing individuals passionate about energy systems and sustainability.

- I am a Masters Student at Hochschule Ansbach. Specializing in Optimization of Energy Systems. 
- I am particulary interested in developing mathematical models for multi-vector energy systems. I always wanted to work in the field of mathematics and sustainability. This is me trying to connect these two aspects of my life.
- I am using Excel, Python, and OCTAVE for my optimization projects.
   
## üìö **Learning Journey**
- I am currently learning performance analysis of Smart Grid. I am also improving on my German Skills. My Entrepreneurship pursuit is Smart Battery System for a apartment home.
- You can find my notes in repositories. Each subject has its own repository. It is a work in progress. 

## ‚ú® Personal Side & Personality
- I love visiting places from books and movies. I also do destiny weekends where I randomly go to Bahnhof and take the random train and visit random villages and cities nearby. Sometimes the journey lasts hours.
- The milestone day of my career would be to witness achievement of a net-zero planet earth. The cherry on the top would be my direct contribution into the achievement

## üõ†Ô∏è **Community, Collaboration & Goals**
- I am open to collaborations in Scientific Writings and projects. It is always fun to work with people from different backgrounds. I hope to connect with enthusiatic people in my life. Ones who have zeal to work towards a bigger goal.
